# IMDB_Rating
IMDb is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. Ratings reflect the quality of every aspect of the film and are becoming an increasingly important factor in the overall success of the film. Ideally, the higher the rating, the better the film. IMDb allows registered users to rate any movie on a scale of 1 to 10. Since the IMDb rating of a movie is important information for the viewer, it is important to make an accurate rating to represent the full range of the movie. Various factors contribute to the high and low IMDb ratings of movies. Some of these factors can be quantified or categorized to build a model for predicting IMDb ratings for movies. The purpose
of this project is to build such a statistical model to predict the IMDb ratings of the unknown 40 movies. The following report discusses the variable distributions and their relationships, the methodology used to build the model, and the results of the final model.
